# Sddm-lain-wired-theme

A sddm login screen inspired by 1998 anime ["Serial Experiments Lain"](https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain)

**Note-
This is a fork.
Original version can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/mixedCase/sddm-lain-wired-theme)**

And now a fork of a fork original by lll2yu on Github. (This version uses qt5)

This one uses qt6, no audio files, and am making some stylistic changes.

# In action :-
You can watch the (original theme) preview video [here.](https://youtu.be/M-p7cHx4OM0)

- Make sure you have sddm installed and configured as your default login manager.
- Install the dependencies ```qt6-quickcontrols``` using your package manager.
